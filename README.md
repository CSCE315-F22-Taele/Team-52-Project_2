### notes to developers

We are adding code regions. If you are using vscode, you can collapse a region by hovering over the line number next to the //region start and clicking the arrow. This is useful for reducing the on-screen clutter when working on a specific part of the code.

You can also open the command palette (ctrl+shift+p) and type "fold" to see the fold commands. Fold/Unfold all regions are particularly useful commands.
